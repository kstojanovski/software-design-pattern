# Software Design Patterns

## Motivation
The motivation was to create mnemonic of the desing pattern derivated from my point of view. The text doesnt describes the pattern isself but how do I understand it.

## Overview of the software design patterns

### Gang of Four design Pattern

Software design pattern were created with the book "Gang of Four design Pattern" in the year 1994/1995.<br>
The "Gang of Four design Pattern" design patterns are separated into three groups.

####	Creational Patterns
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.<br>
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./creational-patterns.md).
####	Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.<br>
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./structural-patterns.md).
####	Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.<br>
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./behavioral-patterns.md).

### J2EE Patterns

These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
The J2EE Patterns can be separated in three groups:

#### Presentation Layer Design Patterns
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./presentation-layer-design-patterns.md).
#### Business Layer Design Patterns
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./business-layer-design-patterns.md).
#### Integration Layer Design Patterns
More about this kind of patterns you can find [here](./integration-layer-design-patterns.md).
